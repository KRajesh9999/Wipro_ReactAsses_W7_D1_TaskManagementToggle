# Task Management Dashboard Application

A simple and modern **Task Management Application** built using **React** and styled with **Bootstrap + custom CSS**.  
This app allows users to add, view, and mark tasks as completed in a clean, card-based UI.
---
## Features
- Add new tasks dynamically.
- Mark tasks as **completed / pending**.
- Display **total tasks** and **completed tasks** count.
- Responsive **card-based layout** with olive-green theme.
- Built using **React Hooks** (`useState`) for state management.
- Demonstrates **Context API** structure for scalable global state (future extension).

## Application Architecture

React Components:
App.js â†’ Root component holding state and UI logic.
Future-ready structure: can be extended with reusable components in /components.

State Management:
Uses React Hooks (useState) for:
Storing tasks
Updating completed status
Managing new task input

## UI Layer
Bootstrap + Custom CSS for styling.
Card-based responsive layout instead of table/list.

## Context API (Scalable Extension):
Currently, state is managed in App.js via useState.
For larger applications, Context API can be introduced:
TaskContext.js â†’ Provides global state.
TaskProvider â†’ Wraps app for centralized task management.
Components consume state via useContext.

## React Hooks & Context API
1. React Hooks
Used to manage useState:
tasks (array of task objects)
newTask (string for input field)

Benefits:
Eliminates class components.
Keeps state logic concise and readable.

2. Context API
This app can easily scale to Context API for global state management.
Advantage:
Avoids prop drilling.
Makes it easier to scale for large applications with multiple pages/components.
